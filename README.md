# FACE SAFE
Face Mask Detection using VGG16

The "Face Mask Detection using VGG16" project is a computer vision application that employs deep learning techniques to identify whether an individual is wearing a face mask or not in images and real-time video. The main objective of this project is to encourage and enforce safety measures, particularly in public spaces, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
## How It Works:
<br>The project employs the popular VGG16 model, which is pre-trained on a large dataset of images, as the core of the face mask detection system.<br/> <br>VGG16 is known for its excellent feature extraction capabilities and has been fine-tuned for this specific task.
As the webcam feed streams, the application continuously captures frames, preprocesses them, and passes them through the VGG16 model. <br/><br>The model then classifies the individuals in the frame as "WithMask" or "WithoutMask."
The results of the classification are displayed on the screen, allowing users to monitor compliance with mask-wearing guidelines in real time.<br/>
## Potential Use Cases:
<br>Public Spaces: This project can be deployed in public spaces such as airports, shopping malls, schools, and public transportation hubs to ensure that individuals are wearing face masks as mandated by local health authorities.<br/>
<br>Businesses and Organizations: Businesses and organizations can use this application to enforce safety measures within their premises, protecting both employees and customers.<br/>
<br>Educational Institutions: Schools and universities can utilize this technology to monitor compliance with mask-wearing policies and take action as necessary.<br/>
<br>Events: Event organizers can use this application to maintain safety during gatherings or events.<br/>
